# Welcome to Emacs, the editor of all time.

## Quick cheat sheet

* C-x C-f opens a file.
* C-x C-c gets you out of Emacs.
* C-x C-s will save what's in the current buffer.
* M-x will open up the Execute Extended Command window.
* C-g will quit out of anything.

## Config-specific commands

* C-c e will evaluate the current buffer as if it were Emacs Lisp.
* C-c t will open the theme switcher.

Enjoy your stay.
